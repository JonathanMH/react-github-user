# React Github User Example

See the demo: [http://projects.jonathanmh.com/react-github-user/](http://projects.jonathanmh.com/react-github-user/)

A tiny example for using facebook's [react][] to make an HTTP request and to plot them into a component, including a [gulp][] task.

Source from the the official react documentation: [Load Initial Data via AJAX](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/initial-ajax.html)

## Installation
You might need to install [gulp][] first with `sudo -H npm install -g gulp`.
Just run `npm install` to get the dependencies and `gulp` to build.

## Usage
Open up index.html and have a look at the code.
